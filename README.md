# Topic Modeling Using Gibbs Sampler

## Synopsis
In this assignment, we implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling of text data.

## Goal
Our goal in this assignment is to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA topic inference using their
representative words. We will use a subset of the 20 newsgroups dataset (given with this assignment). 

## Implementation
This project was done in C++. Its very hard to implement in cpp, but its amazingly fun :p
